# Task Tracker Stopwatch

This project is a **Task Tracker Stopwatch**, a web-based application designed to help users manage their tasks while keeping track of time. It's an interactive and visually appealing application aimed at boosting productivity and organization.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Toggle the stopwatch with a single button that dynamically updates between "Start" and "Pause".
- **Reset Timer**: Clear the timer to start fresh.
- **Record Time**: Record the current time and associate it with a selected task.

### Task Management
- **Add Tasks**: Input task names and dynamically add them to a dropdown menu.
- **Select Tasks**: Choose tasks from a dropdown menu to associate with recorded times.
- **Display Current Task**: Dynamically updates the current task title based on the selected task.

### Time Management
- **Set Timer**: Manually set the stopwatch to a specific time (hours, minutes, seconds) before starting.
- **Recorded Times**: Displays all recorded times in a scrollable box, associating each time with the selected task.
- **Clear Recorded Times**: Clear all recorded entries with a single button.

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is visually appealing across devices.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Buttons and interactive elements change color on hover and state changes.
- **Ellipsis Handling**: Long task names in the dropdown menu are truncated with ellipses to maintain layout consistency.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the web app.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean and modern interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for stopwatch functionality, task management, and interactivity.

   - The task will be added to the dropdown menu for selection.

2. **Select a Task**:

## Advanced Features (Planned Improvements)

- **Web Speech API Integration**:
  - Control the stopwatch (start, stop, reset, record) using voice commands for a hands-free experience.
- **Dark Mode**:
  - Add a dark mode toggle for improved usability in low-light conditions.
- **Analytics Dashboard**:
  - Visualize time spent on each task with charts and graphs.

## Challenges Faced
- **Dynamic Styling**: Ensuring buttons dynamically update styles and hover effects based on their state.
